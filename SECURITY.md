## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users.

### 2. Email us directly

Send details to: **security@tasawwur-rtc.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Your contact information (optional)

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: We'll work with you to resolve the issue
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure after fixes are deployed

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   # Android SDK
   cd sdk-android && ./gradlew dependencyUpdates
   
   # Backend services
   cd backend-services && mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
   
   # Frontend
   cd dashboard-frontend && npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use secure configurations**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Enable authentication for all endpoints
   - Use strong JWT secrets
   - Enable rate limiting

3. **Regular security scanning**
   ```bash
   # Run security scans
   make security
   ```

### For Users

1. **Token Management**
   - Never commit tokens to version control
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Use environment variables for secrets

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

3. **Access Control**
   - Implement proper user authentication
   - Use role-based access control
   - Validate all user inputs
